## ChoiCo Predefined Dashboard

The dashboard contains two tabs, **ChoiCo Playmode Behavior** and **ChoiCo Designing Behavior**.

### ChoiCo Playmode Behavior

This tab shows a summary about the created and most visited places in the games,
the number of times learners played the game and the performance (as final game scores) after each game over event.

If you want to see on the individual level, then you need to switch to Groups mode in the upper right corner of the page.

The pie chart with all the places will then be generated for each individual learner (or group of learners) as shown in the image below.

<div class="!mt-16">
	The **Game attempts** section contains a pie chart on the left side, showing
	the number of times the learners played the games. On the right side, a step
	line chart is presented to visualize the progress of the game progress over
	attempts. It is also possible to filter out learners and see only individual
	learner by unselecting them in the chart legend.
</div>

### ChoiCo Designing Behavior

**ChoiCo Designing Behavior** provides a summary of the events generated in _design_ and _play_ modes,
adding/modifying points in the map.

The same can be done for individual learners by switching to group mode.

Additionally, it shows a bar chart (in class level) of the editing places to compare which places were
the most modified (edited) by learners, and a pie chart for coding events such as writing initial values
or/and game ending rules.

and the same but for individual learners:

## Sorbet Predefined Dashboard

The dashboard shows on the left side the total time spend in minutes by all learners in the learning activity and
the pie chart with total correctly classified and wrongly classified objects.

![Sorbet game duration class level](@images/dashboard/dashboard_3_9.png)

and for individual mode, it shows the table with learner id, total time in minutes spend in the learning activity,
total of correctly classified objects, total wrongly classified objects, and total objects created in the games.
If the values are empty in the tables, it means no events were generated for this learner.

## Malt2 Predefined Dashboard

The dashboard contains three tabs, **Code History**, **Slider Interactions**, and **Camera Interactions**.

### Code History

In **Code History** you need to switch to the Groups mode (individual mode) and then select the learner from the drop down list.
Then the dashboard will show the lines of code at the beginning of the learning activity.

![Malt2 code history](@images/dashboard/dashboard_3_11.png)

It is possible to scroll for each iteration/change in the code and see how the code was modified

### Slider Interactions

**Slider Interactions** shows a box plot with min,max and mean initial and final values for each slider.
