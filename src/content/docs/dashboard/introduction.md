This dashboard provides an interactive web tool for visualizing data collected through learning analytics. It processes event-based user interactions with learning tools such as Choico, Sorbet, Malt2, and Gears, and presents the data in meaningful and actionable ways for different user groups.
Educators can use the dashboard to gain insights into studentsâ€™ motivation, understanding, creativity, experimentation, and interaction with the learning tools. It also allows the monitoring of learning progress and the identification of areas where additional support may be needed.
Learners benefit from personalized feedback on their learning activities, helping them track their performance and improve their learning strategies.
Researchers can explore rich datasets for understanding learning behaviors, assess the effectiveness of learning tools, and contribute to the development of more advanced learning analytics.
Over time, by collecting and processing historical user interaction data, the dashboard aims to deliver more meaningful visualizations for learners and educators, and will enable the measurement of 21st-century skills.
