Educators are users that can design activities by using the available educational tools
provided in the platform. They can create and manage learner groups by assigning learners
from their institution to those groups. They can assign activities to these learner groups
and view the completed activities of individual learners.

## Login

<strong>Educators cannot register by themselves.</strong> Instead, the
institution administrator registers them.

<Aside type="caution">
	When your institution administrator registers you in the Platform you will
	receive a verification email.
	<b>Follow the instructions in the email to retrieve your credentials.</b>
	You will need them to log in to the Exten(DT)² Platform.
</Aside>
