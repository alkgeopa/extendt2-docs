The Exten(DT)² platform is an ecosystem of diverse web-based learning environments and
supportive technologies. The platform allows the design, development and deployment
of highly interactive, constructionist design thinking activities for learners of all ages.

In order to get the best experience using the platform it is advisable to read the documentation
carefully.

## How to use the docs

The documentation pages (docs) are grouped based on the associated technology or tool.
You can access all these groups from the left sidebar.

<BrowserWindow url="extendt2.com/docs/getting-started/welcome/">
	<Image
		src={start_1}
		alt="Sidebar with grouped content"
		width={start_1.width}
		height="auto"
	/>
	<span slot="caption">Sidebar with grouped content</span>
</BrowserWindow>

Some of the content may not be ready yet. Incomplete pages are marked with an appropriate badge.

The main content of the page sits in the middle
<BrowserWindow url="extendt2.com/docs/getting-started/welcome/">
	<Image
		src={start_2}
		alt="Main content"
		width={start_2.width}
		height="auto"
	/>
	<span slot="caption">Main content</span>
</BrowserWindow>

On the right there is a table of content for the current page. Use this to quickly
navigate to your desired section.
<BrowserWindow url="extendt2.com/docs/sorbet/play-the-game/">
	<Image
		src={start_3}
		alt="Table of contents of the page"
		width={start_3.width}
		height="auto"
	/>
	<span slot="caption">Table of contents of the page</span>
</BrowserWindow>

If you need to search for specific content, keywords etc. use the search box at the top.
