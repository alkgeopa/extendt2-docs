In case you choose to modify an existing ChoiCo game or a game stored locally on
your computer, you can edit its functions and settings via the **Design Mode**. After
opening the desired game, select the "Design" button on the top right (Figure 34).

This opens the game in **Design Mode**, where it is possible to modify
the game elements, such as:

- change in the values of the fields
- adding or removing fields
- change the type of variables in the fields
- adding or removing points or levels on the map
- change the map image
- changes to the game programming

The editing environment is the same as the [Design Mode](/docs/choico/design-mode).
