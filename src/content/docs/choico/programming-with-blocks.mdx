This section describes the ChoiCo programming environment.

<Aside>
	Find a complete list of all ChoiCo commands with detailed descriptions and
	usage examples at http://etl.ppp.uoa.gr/choico/blocksEn.html or in the{' '}
	<kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">Help</kbd> drop-down menu, by selecting{' '}
	<b>Blocks Library</b>.
</Aside>

The programming environment consists of two parts:

1. the left side-bar
2. the workspace on the right

The sidebar contains all the available blocks that can be used to design a game.

While ChoiCo has 3 different "programming" workspaces (initial settings, gameplay
rules, end rules), there are some differences in the available blocks depending on
the functionality of each workspace.

Different blocks can be linked together if they have edges that fit, like puzzle
pieces.

## Delete a block

To **delete** a block or a group of linked blocks, you can do one of the following:

-   Right-click on it and select "Delete block"

## Disable a block

To disable a block or a group of connected blocks, you need to right-click on it and
select **Disable Block**. The blocks will appear as disabled in the workspace and will
not be executed. You can enable it again by right-clicking and selecting
**Enable Block**.

## Collapse a block

To collapse a block or a group of connected blocks, you need to right-click on it
and select **Collapse block**. The blocks will be collapsed and represented by a single
block. You can expand the block again by right clicking on the individual block and
selecting **Expand block**.

This is a very useful function if you want to save space.

(or <kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd class="kbd kbd-sm">z</kbd> in macOS).
