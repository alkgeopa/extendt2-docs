## Choose a ready-made ChoiCo game

By selecting one of the existing online games in the <kbd class="kbd">Play Online Games</kbd> menu,
ChoiCo enters "Game Mode" and thus enables the user to start the game.

Through a pop-up window, **Game Instructions** first appear,
with information and details about the game such as its story, the
purpose, the objectives or any additional information you need to know about the
game flow and development. To start the game, select
<kbd class="kbd bg-green-500 text-white">Let’s Play!</kbd>.

## ChoiCo game detailed description

A ChoiCo game consists of 3 elements:

-   The **Scene**, i.e. the game interface, where the selected theme or socioscientific issue embedded in the game is simulated with a background image
    (e.g. the map of a city) on which all available choices are pinned. Depending
    on the game scenario, these options may represent various things, such as
    places you can visit on a map, places or foods to eat, people you can talk
    to, or objects to use.

-   The **Game Values Table**, that shows the game fields (parameters) and
    their current values as they change depending on the player's choices during
    the game.

-   The **Point Information Table**, which shows the consequences of a
    choice on the values of the game fields along with other information (e.g.
    explanatory text).

_Figure 7: ChoiCo in Game Mode – Covid Survival Game_

According to the example of the game "Covid Survival", the available options are
pinned to an illustrated map of a city. These options represent different parts
of the city that the player can visit or different activities that the player can
do during the COVID pandemic.

_Figure 8: Illustrated City Map - "Covid Survival" Game_

The fields of the game and their values are displayed in the **Game Values Table**
which is always located in the upper left part of the screen, with the last column of
the table counting the total number of choices of the player.

_Figure 9: Game Values Table - "Covid Survival" Game_

When any point on the map is clicked, the **Point Information Table** appears
on the right of the screen. There, you can find out about the consequences that
this choice will have on the values of the fields. Some consequences
will increase the values of certain fields, while some others will decrease them. At
this table, you may also have some additional information, e.g. a description or an
image. The values that each field can take at the corresponding point is a subject
of discussion that will be further analyzed in the section on designing and modifying
a ChoiCo game.

You can select each point by clicking the <kbd class="kbd bg-amber-500 text-black">Select point</kbd> button.

_Figure 10: Point Information Table - "Covid Survival" Game_

For example, if you click the "Supermarket" point on the map, 15 points will be
added to the Physical Condition field, since you will be moving outside the house,
and 23 to the Sociability field, since when you go to the Supermarket you may
meet different people. At the same time, this option will subtract 20 points from
the Fun field, since it can be a tiring activity, and 20 points from the Money field,
since you are going to spend money.

If you end up choosing this point, these values will be added or subtracted,
respectively, from the values of the fields in the game. The game state will then be
configured according to the point you selected and you will probably receive some
feedback from the system.

## End Game

Whether you have chosen to play one of the ready-made examples or load a saved
game from your files, the game ends when one (or more) field value crosses the
"red lines" as they have been defined during the design of the game. When the
game is finished, the following pop-up notification box appears where you can:

1. play again by selecting the <kbd class="kbd bg-amber-500 text-black">Play Again</kbd>.

2. display in detail the results and statistics of the game you just played by
   selecting <kbd class="kbd bg-amber-500 text-black">Show score and statistics</kbd>. From there, you can
   also download your score in a pdf file.

3. edit the game by selecting <kbd class="kbd bg-amber-500 text-black">Edit Game</kbd>. More
   information in Section 4.
