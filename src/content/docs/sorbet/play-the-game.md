## Selecting an existing, online game

By selecting one of the online games, you enter **Play Mode** and you get
the role of the player.

By pressing the <kbd class="kbd bg-green-500 text-white">START</kbd> button, the game begins with objects (text or image)
falling at a certain rate. In this example, the objects are images and names of
seasonal fruits. At the bottom of the screen, carton boxes visualize the categories
into which the objects should be classified. In our example, the categories represent
the four seasons (summer, autumn, winter and spring).

The object needs to “touch” the category box to be considered as classified to this
specific category. When an object is correctly classified in its category, the box
turns green and the score increases by 1. As you can see, the orange is
correctly classified as winter fruit. In case the object is classified into the wrong
category, the box turns red and the score isn’t affected. For example,
apricot is not set as a summer fruit and as a result, classifying it to summer leads
to an incorrect result.

The score counter is at the top left of the screen and has the form of
**x/y**, where **x** is the number of objects correctly classified and **y** is the number of
total objects to be classified.

## Load your game

In the [Homepage](/docs/sorbet/home-page), by selecting the <kbd class="kbd">Load Game</kbd> button you have the chance
to upload and play your own classification games. You should have previously
designed and saved them in your device as described in [Design a new game]().

## End Game

Whether you have chosen to play one of the ready-made examples or have loaded
a game from your file, the game ends when all the objects to be sorted are dropped.
You can also end the game at any time by pressing the <kbd class="kbd bg-red-600 text-white">Stop</kbd> button in the left-hand
column of the screen.

When the game ends, the following notification box appears, where you
can choose to display the scores and statistics of the game in detail, by pressing
<kbd class="kbd bg-yellow-500 text-black">Show Score and Statistics</kbd>.

You can advise this board to reflect on how you classified the game
objects and how you can improve the gameplay if you replay.

The statistics show, apart from your score, how you have
classified the falling objects into the game categories and which of them you didn’t
classify to any category (“unclassified”). The latter refers to objects that “fell into”
the gap between categories.

As shown in the screenshot above (Figure 10), you can download your scores and
statistics in tabular format to a .pdf file by clicking <kbd class="kbd bg-blue-500 text-white">Download Score</kbd> and close
the window by clicking <kbd class="kbd bg-red-600 text-white">Close</kbd>.
