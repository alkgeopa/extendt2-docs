If you wish to edit the settings of a ready-made game that is online, or one from
your device, because e.g. you may need to fix something, you disagree with
the assignments or you just want to make it more meaningful to you, you should
enter the **Edit Mode**.

## Edit Mode

First, you need to select the specific game if it is from the online examples,
or load it from your device (see [Load Game](/docs/sorbet/play-the-game#load-your-game)) and then select
<kbd class="kbd bg-yellow-500 text-black">Edit</kbd> from the top right.

Then, the game opens in **Design Mode** where you will be able to
modify the existing game elements, add or remove objects and columns, change
the display number of the objects, and also the correspondence of classifying them
into categories.

For example, when editing the **_Seasonal Fruits_** game , we notice that
the
**_apricot_** object is assigned to the **_spring_** category. If you believe that
it should also belong to the **_summer_** category, you can select the corresponding
checkbox and either uncheck the **_spring_** checkbox or leave both categories as
correct, since SorBET allows one-to-many classification.

## Manage Categories

Moreover, you can add a new category e.g. **_All year_**, if some fruits thrive
in all seasons, by selecting the **Add Category** button in the columns of the
categories or remove another by selecting one that you don’t think as
necessary category and delete it e.g. **_Autumn_** (Figure 16).

## Manage Objects

### Add or remove objects

You can also delete some of the existing objects by clicking **Delete object**
button on top of the table rows or add more objects in the game, e.g.
more of your favorite fruits, using the adjacent **Add object** button.

### Object customization

Once you add or modify an object, you can select the object type, i.e. whether it is
going to be text or image.

If you select the text type, you can type in the textbox the text to appear (it
supports both Greek and English characters, numbers and special symbols).
If you select the image type, you can upload an image from your computer that
will represent the falling object.

<Aside>
    The image should already be saved in your device.
</Aside>

Moreover, you can modify the number of instances of each object that will appear
during the gameplay. This means that if e.g. you put the number 3 next to the apricot
object, three instances of this object will fall during the same game at a random
time and order.

### Play or download the game

After you finish editing the game you can play it online to see how it looks. To do
so, click <kbd class="kbd bg-green-600 text-white">Play</kbd> at the upper
right of the screen. You can also download it to your computer in order to edit it later,
share it with others, or just save it in your archives. To download the game, click
<kbd class="kbd bg-blue-600 text-white !m-0">Download</kbd> at the upper right of the screen.
