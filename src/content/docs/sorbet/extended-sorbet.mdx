SorBET was extended to enhance game play and game design experience, as part
of the EU project Extending Design Thinking with Emerging Digital Technologies
(Exten(DT)<sup>2</sup>).

You can find the extended version <a href="https://extendt2.com/widgets/sorbetEXT/" target="_blank">here</a>.

SorBET EXT evolved throughout game play in the form of bodily interaction with
falling items. The extension allows students to interact with the game physically,
in bigger or smaller visual settings, and it can encourage multiple players engaging
with the same game simultaneously, facilitating embodied collaborative learning
experiences.

In terms of game design experience, SorBET includs simple programming instructions
in block format, that allow creating and manipulating features such as the pace and
density of objects rupture.

## Homepage

When you access SorBET EXT, you first need to give access to the platform to use
your camera settings. To do that, simply click on the checkbox as seen here.

![Activate Camera](@images/sorbet/sorbet_6_1.png)
_Figure 32: Activate Camera_

When you try to open a game (see [Selecting an existing, online game](/docs/sorbet/play-the-game#selecting-an-online-existing-game))
e.g. one of the Online Examples, a browser pop-up window will appear confirming
the request to use the camera and microphone. Click on <kbd class="kbd">Allow</kbd> to give access.

Once the game loads, click <kbd class="kbd bg-green-500 text-white">START</kbd>
and try moving your hands in front of the camera and see its digital depiction on
the game screen. The system recognizes up to 2 palms at a time.

## Edit an EXT game

In the EXT version of SorBET, you have the ability to modify the speed and density
of the falling objects using commands in block format.

When you access the **Design Mode** either from **Play Mode** (see [Edit a Game](/docs/sorbet/edit-a-game)) or
when designing a game from scratch (see [Design a new Game](/docs/sorbet/design-a-game)), in addition
to the classification database you can find the **Blockly** commands environment
using the <kbd class="kbd">Gamestart</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">Gameplay</kbd> tabs.

![Blockly Commands Environment](@/assets/images/sorbet/sorbet_6_5.png)
_Figure 35: Blockly Commands Environment_

### Gamestart Tab

![Gamestart Tab](@/assets/images/sorbet/sorbet_6_6.png)
_Figure 36: Gamestart Tab_

In the first tab (Figure 36), you can set the **initial values** of speed & density. In
other words, you set the values with which the objects start dropping at the
beginning of the game.

**Initialize** the speed and density values by simply clicking on the number field and
changing it.

The initial values already set by the game are **50** for speed and **34** for density.
Thus, choosing **lower values decreases** the speed or density respectively, and
choosing **higher values increases** them.

<Aside>
	<p>
		Keep in mind that these values are not absolute but relative to the
		previous value of the variables.
	</p>
	<p>
		E.g. if you set density level to 100 it won’t show all the objects
		together at once but with a higher rate than they would if the level was
		34.
	</p>
	<ul class="mt-1 list-disc pl-4 font-bold">
		<li>
			avoid using zero (0) as a value, as it will not affect the sizes
		</li>
		<li>all numbers should be positive</li>
	</ul>
</Aside>

### Gameplay Tab

<div class="flex flex-col items-center gap-x-4 sm:flex-row">
	<Image
		src={gameplayTab}
		alt="Gameplay Tab"
		height="300"
		width="300"
		class="shadow"
	/>
	<div role="alert" class="alert !mt-0 shadow-lg rounded-none">
		<div class="not-content leading-normal">
			<span class="text-lg font-bold">Keep in mind that:</span>
			<ul class="mt-1 list-disc pl-4">
				<li>
					<span class="font-bold text-blue-600">change ... by</span>{' '}
					will increase the current size by the amount you specify
					(e.g. change speed by 10, will add 10 to the previous value
					of speed)
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="font-bold text-blue-600">set ... by</span> sets
					a specific value (e.g. set speed to 100, will replace
					whatever value the speed had before with 100)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

In the second tab, you can set a **condition** <code>If..else</code> that has to be satisfied in
order to **alter the value of a variable** (speed or density).

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 items-center gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2">
	<span>
		e.g. As the <b>score increases</b>, set a <b>higher speed</b> for the
		falling objects:
	</span>
	<Image
		src={blocklyScore}
		alt="blockly score"
		height="300"
		width="300"
		class="shadow-lg"
	/>
	<span>
		Or when the <b>speed is too high, decrease the density</b> of objects:
	</span>
	<Image
		src={blocklySpeed}
		alt="blockly speed"
		height="300"
		width="300"
		class="shadow-lg"
	/>
</div>

## Programming Commands using Blockly

<div class="not-content mb-16 grid grid-cols-1 items-center gap-x-4 gap-y-8 sm:grid-cols-2">
	<div>
		<div class="font-bold">Add a new block</div>
		Click on the block you want from the blocks library and drop it in the
		position you want into the programming area.
	</div>
	<Image src={addBlock} alt="blockly score" height="300" width="300" />
	<div>
		<div class="font-bold">Delete a block</div>
		To Delete a block or a set of connected blocks, you can either
		<ul class="list-disc pl-4">
			<li>
				Right click on it and select <b>Delete block</b> <em>OR</em>
			</li>
			<li>
				Drag it and drop it to the blocks library on the left of the
				screen
			</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="font-bold">Copy a block</div>
		To copy a single block or a set of connected blocks right click on
		it/them and select <b>Duplicate</b>
	</div>
